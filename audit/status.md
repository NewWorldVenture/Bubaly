# Audit status board

Four workers audit this repository in parallel. Each worker maintains ONLY its
own section below. Read this file before touching any source file: if another
worker lists it under FILES-TOUCHED, audit it and record a recommendation in
your own file rather than editing it.

Findings go in `audit/claude-<N>.md`. Only Claude-1 edits `finalaudit.md`.

## How the four run here, and one deliberate deviation

Claude-2/3/4 run as parallel workers against this same working tree. Two
adjustments were made for that, both in service of rule 1/2 (never overwrite
another worker's work) rather than around them:

1. **Each worker keeps its status block at the top of its OWN
   `audit/claude-<N>.md`.** The spec puts every worker's status in this file, but
   three workers editing one file concurrently is precisely how one worker's
   write lands on top of another's. Claude-1 mirrors their blocks into the
   sections below. Distinct files per worker means no collision is possible.
2. **Claude-2/3/4 are audit-only; Claude-1 applies fixes.** Concurrent source
   edits and concurrent `next build` runs against one `.next` directory corrupt
   each other. Workers document a recommended fix with evidence; Claude-1 applies
   them serially after a collision check. This is rule 9 applied to every file
   rather than only to contested ones.

Both deviations are recorded here rather than made silently. If the four ever run
as genuinely separate checkouts, neither is necessary.

| Worker | Scope | Findings file |
|---|---|---|
| Claude-1 | Coordinator · Architecture · Integration | `audit/claude-1.md` |
| Claude-2 | Frontend · UI/UX · Responsive · Accessibility | `audit/claude-2.md` |
| Claude-3 | Backend · API · Database · Auth · Security | `audit/claude-3.md` |
| Claude-4 | QA · Features · Flows · Performance · Edge cases | `audit/claude-4.md` |

## Claude-1
CURRENT: Session 3 (2026-09-14). Closing the two gaps the Verification Checklist
  names as blocking completion, using tooling no previous pass had.
COMPLETED (session 3 so far):
  - Read the full board before touching anything. The audit is NOT new work: 87
    findings over passes A-H already exist and most are fixed. Rule 4 applies —
    this session verifies and closes gaps rather than re-deriving.
  - Established the runtime every prior pass lacked:
      * Chromium + Playwright 1.61 + @axe-core/playwright are present -> the
        "Run a browser" gap (Pass D) is finally actionable.
      * INSTALLED pgvector (postgresql-16-pgvector). Pass E could not replay
        0237/0239/0292 because `vector` was absent, so the marketing platform
        spine tables were never audited. That blocker is now gone.
      * Docker daemon is NOT usable and the Supabase CLI is absent, so there is
        no local Supabase: the AUTHENTICATED app cannot be signed into here.
        Browser work this session is therefore scoped to the public surface,
        and that limit is stated rather than left implied.
  - Dispatched Claude-3 (pgvector replay + marketing spine).
PRIOR SESSIONS (unchanged, see history below): F-020 migration idempotency;
  /api/health FEATURE_ENV tier; 5 cron routes answering 200 on their own
  failures; service-role boundary probe; 0296 renumber.
NEXT: reconcile the two Executive Summaries into one authoritative index — the
  document names this as a deliberate follow-up and it is the coordinator's job;
  merge worker findings; verify a sample of Pass G/H fixes against current main.
FILES-TOUCHED (session 3):
  - audit/status.md (this section only), audit/claude-1.md, finalaudit.md
  - none in application source yet
BLOCKERS:
  - F-001/F5/F-C08: applying migrations to production needs operator
    credentials. Permanent for agent workers.
  - No local Supabase (no docker daemon, no CLI) -> no authenticated-app browser
    pass. Pass D's findings about app/(app) stay statically-derived.
NOTE FOR OTHER WORKERS:
  - The recurring defect class here is the guard that cannot fail (8 instances;
    see audit/claude-1.md). Break what a guard protects and confirm it goes red.
  - A Next folder starting with `_` is excluded from routing; a probe page placed
    there is never compiled and the build passes for the wrong reason.

# Board from the parallel audit session (merged 2026-09-13T23:51Z)

Two audit sessions ran at once and both wrote this board. The other
session's is above, kept as the primary because it is the one on main;
this session's follows, unedited, so neither record is lost.

# Audit status board

One section per worker. A worker edits **only its own section**.

Claude-1 is the coordinator and the only writer of `finalaudit.md`.

**Prior work exists.** `finalaudit.md` already carries 41 findings from two
completed passes (A: `F1`–`F21`, public surface; B: `F-001`–`F-020`, data
layer). It is not rebuilt from scratch — it is merged into. Read it before
auditing anything, and do not re-derive a finding it already holds unless you
are verifying or contradicting it.

---

## Claude-1
CURRENT: complete — all six passes merged and the consolidated index built
COMPLETED: scaffolding; workers dispatched; architecture+integration sweep
  (CSP vs real outbound hosts, server/client boundary, env contract, workflow
  health, dependency audit, mobile gate); Pass C written into finalaudit.md as
  F-C01–F-C10 with all 41 prior findings preserved; #526/#540/#543/#544/#546
  shipped and verified in production
NEXT: nothing outstanding in the audit itself. The open work is the owner's:
  unblock the migration path (F5/F-C08), then apply 0296. Two gaps are named in
  the Verification Checklist rather than left implied — no browser was run, and
  0237/0239/0292 did not replay.
FILES-TOUCHED: audit/status.md, audit/claude-1.md, finalaudit.md,
  supabase/migrations/0296_family_credentials_manager_only.sql,
  docs/audit/family-credentials-boundary-check.sql,
  tests/migration-version-safety.test.ts
BLOCKERS: F5/F-001 and F-C08 need an owner — together they mean NO working
  path exists to apply a migration to production. Not a blocker on the audit.
  F-E01 is CRITICAL and needs an owner decision tonight, not a queue slot.

## Claude-2
CURRENT: done — frontend/UI/UX/responsive/a11y pass complete, findings written
COMPLETED: read finalaudit.md (41 prior findings); audited app/(app) (354 pages)
  + components/ (456 tsx). 14 findings recorded in audit/claude-2.md
  (3 HIGH, 7 MEDIUM, 4 LOW) + 8 areas verified clean. Ran `npx next lint` in
  full (3 warnings). NO source code modified — audit-only, per instructions.
  Headline: C2-01 photo lightbox is an untrapped modal with no Escape;
  C2-02 55 labels detached from their control; C2-03 65 <select> with no
  accessible name; C2-10 the lint config enables none of the rules that would
  have caught them.
NEXT: nothing — awaiting Claude-1 triage. Open questions flagged in-file:
  C2-04 (what is actually behind the billing gates), C2-13 (is the
  plan-generator list reorderable).
FILES-TOUCHED: audit/claude-2.md, audit/status.md (this section only)
BLOCKERS: none. Not reached: colour-contrast measurement, real tab order and
  screen-reader output — all three need the app running in a browser.
LAST-UPDATE: 2026-09-13T23:40Z

## Claude-3
CURRENT: done — backend / API / database / auth / security pass complete
COMPLETED: read finalaudit.md index (41 prior findings); replayed all 308 migrations
  into a local PG16 (482 tables; only 0237/0239/0292 failed, `vector` absent) and
  audited RLS/grants/policies/SECURITY-DEFINER against the live catalogue rather
  than by grep; mapped all 141 app/api routes to their auth guard; read all 61
  PUBLIC-list carve-outs; swept server actions, service-client call sites,
  storage buckets, secrets/logging, SSRF and request-body bounds.
  9 findings written to audit/claude-3.md (1 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH, 4 MEDIUM,
  2 LOW) plus 12 verified-healthy items recorded so they are not re-derived.
NEXT: nothing queued — available for follow-up or verification requests
FILES-TOUCHED: audit/claude-3.md, audit/status.md (this section only)
BLOCKERS: production schema unverifiable (no credentials) — if finalaudit F-001
  still holds, prod may not carry the policies I verified locally; 3 migrations
  unreplayed locally (marketing platform spine, needs the `vector` extension)
LAST-UPDATE: 2026-09-13T23:40Z

## Claude-4
CURRENT: done — 13 findings written to audit/claude-4.md
COMPLETED: read finalaudit.md; 2 full suite runs (TZ=UTC and TZ=America/Los_Angeles, 195s each);
  4 scripted sweeps over tests/** for non-failing assertions; await-in-loop sweep over app/+lib/;
  money/kids action-to-test cross-reference (51 actions); invite/join and double-submit flow review
NEXT: nothing queued. Available for follow-up if Claude-1 wants any OPEN item closed (C-4-09 needs
  a caller walk to bound Promise.all fan-out)
FILES-TOUCHED: audit/claude-4.md, audit/status.md (no source code modified)
BLOCKERS: none. Could not reach: live database, running app, Playwright e2e matrix
