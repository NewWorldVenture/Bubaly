## Sweep 1 — feature gates that cannot fail

Method: extract every href literal passed to `requireFeature()`,
`refuseUnlessEntitled()`, `familyHasFeature()` and `resolveFeatureEntitlement()`
across `app/`, `lib/`, `components/` (worktrees under `.claude/` and `tests/`
excluded — an earlier pass of this scan reported 84 "readers" of one table and
every one of them was a `.claude/worktrees/` copy), and diff that set against the
100 `href` values in `lib/constants/feature-catalog.ts`.

81 distinct gate keys are in use. 79 resolve. **Two do not.**

### [CLAUDE-4][HIGH][FEATURES] Vacation Planner and Weekend Planner are gated with a key the catalog does not contain, so 21 gate call sites allow everyone

- **File:** `lib/constants/feature-catalog.ts:22-149` (the catalog) vs
  `app/(app)/dashboard/vacations/page.tsx:8`, `app/(app)/dashboard/vacations/new/page.tsx:8`,
  `app/(app)/dashboard/vacations/[id]/layout.tsx:16`, the eleven
  `app/(app)/dashboard/vacations/[id]/*/page.tsx` tabs,
  `app/(app)/dashboard/vacations/calendar/page.tsx:8`,
  `app/(app)/dashboard/vacations/reports/page.tsx:8`,
  `app/(app)/dashboard/weekend/page.tsx:8`,
  `app/api/vacations/ai/route.ts:37`, `app/api/vacations/weather/route.ts:22`,
  `app/api/weekend/discover/route.ts:35`
- **Problem:** `resolveFeatureEntitlement` (`lib/server/feature-entitlement.ts:63-66`)
  is explicit that an href absent from the catalog is **not gated**:

  ```ts
  const tier = byHref[href];
  if (tier === undefined) return { allowed: true, planLevel };
  ```

  `/dashboard/vacations` and `/dashboard/weekend` are absent. The catalog carries
  `F('trips', …, 'basic', '/dashboard/trips')` — a *different* route, a different
  page — and has no entry for either of these two. Every one of the 21 call sites
  therefore resolves `allowed: true` for every family on every plan, including a
  family whose trial has lapsed to Free.
- **Evidence:** bundled `lib/features/tiers.ts` + the catalog with esbuild and
  evaluated the resolver's own input map:

  ```
  $ node gate1.cjs
  /dashboard/vacations     => undefined
  /dashboard/weekend       => undefined
  /dashboard/trips         => "basic"
  /dashboard/chores        => "free"
  catalog has /dashboard/vacations? false
  catalog has /dashboard/weekend?   false
  ```

  `tiersByHref` is the only source `resolveFeatureEntitlement` consults, and
  `requireFeature` / `refuseUnlessEntitled` are both thin wrappers over it
  (`lib/supabase/auth.ts:246`, `lib/server/route-feature-gate.ts:39-40`). Neither
  page nor route carries any second gate — `grep -rn "requirePlanLevel\|planLevel"`
  over `app/(app)/dashboard/{weekend,vacations}` and `app/api/{weekend,vacations}`
  returns nothing.
- **Impact:** three ways.
  1. `lib/constants/navigation.ts:161,162` publishes both as `minLevel: 1`
     (Family Basic+), and `resolveItems` (`components/app/nav-shared.tsx:63-64`)
     decides locked/unlocked from `featureTiers[item.href]`, **not** from
     `minLevel` — so an undefined tier renders the item as a normal, unlocked
     link. A Free family sees "Vacation Planner" and "Weekend Planner", clicks
     through, and gets the whole 13-tab trip workspace the plan does not sell.
  2. `/api/vacations/ai` calls a model (`resolveProvider`, line 39 onward) with
     only a 20/window rate limit in front of it, and `/api/weekend/discover`
     fans out to Ticketmaster and SeatGeek on the deployment's own API keys.
     Both are billed per request and both are open to Free.
  3. The `/pricing` grid is generated from this same catalog
     (`app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx:46`), so neither feature appears on any
     published plan at all. The product sells neither and the code gives both
     away — the mirror image of Pass L.
- **Fix:** add the two missing rows to `FEATURE_CATALOG`, at the tier the nav
  already claims:
  `F('vacations', 'Vacation Planner', 'Family & Home', 'basic', '/dashboard/vacations')`
  and `F('weekend-planner', 'Weekend Planner', 'Family & Home', 'basic', '/dashboard/weekend')`.
  No call site changes. Then close the class: a test that asserts every href
  literal reaching `requireFeature`/`refuseUnlessEntitled` exists in
  `tiersByHref(resolveFeatureTiers({}))` — the scan above, as a guard.
- **Status:** OPEN

### [CLAUDE-4][MEDIUM][TESTS] `tests/route-plan-gate.test.ts` asserts the gate's source text, so it passes over three routes where the gate does nothing

- **File:** `tests/route-plan-gate.test.ts:136-138`, assertion at `:147-150`
- **Problem:** the table-driven half of this suite reads each route's **source**
  and asserts a substring:

  ```ts
  const source = stripComments(read(route));
  expect(source).toContain('refuseUnlessEntitled(');
  for (const href of hrefs) expect(source).toContain(`'${href}'`);
  ```

  That is a check that the line was typed, not that it refuses anybody. Three of
  its twenty entries — `weekend/discover`, `vacations/ai`, `vacations/weather` —
  name hrefs the catalog does not contain, so at runtime the gate they assert
  returns `allowed: true` for every family. The test is green today and would
  stay green if the catalog were emptied.
- **Evidence:** the file's own first `describe` shows the shape that *would* have
  caught it — it drives `app/api/ai/savings/route.ts` against an in-memory
  Supabase seeded with a `free` and a `plus` family and asserts `403` /
  `needLevel: 1` / the rate limiter never being reached. Exactly one route
  (`ai/savings`) gets that treatment; the other nineteen get the substring check.
  Behavioural proof of the gap is in the finding above.
- **Impact:** this is the guard that exists specifically to stop an AI endpoint
  serving a family that is not entitled, and it is structurally incapable of
  seeing the case where the entitlement key is wrong — which is the only way the
  gate can be present and still not gate.
- **Fix:** keep the substring check (it is a cheap regression net for a deleted
  line) and add one assertion beside it that costs nothing:

  ```ts
  const byHref = tiersByHref(resolveFeatureTiers({}));
  for (const href of hrefs) expect(byHref[href]).toBeDefined();
  ```

  Revert the catalog fix and this goes red on three rows; with the fix it is
  green. Better still, extend the `savings` harness to run the whole `GATED`
  table — the mocks are already generic.
- **Status:** OPEN
