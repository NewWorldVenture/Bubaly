# Claude-4 — QA / Features / Flows / Performance / Edge Cases

CURRENT: Vacuous-guard sweep + scale/edge-case sweep. Auth-admin row ceiling found and confirmed.
COMPLETED:
  - Test-corpus survey: 1,194 test files; 3 skip markers (all conditional E2E gates); 0 `it.todo`;
    0 tautological `expect(true).toBe(true)`; 0 empty `catch {}` swallowing an assertion.
  - Loop-vacuity scan: 664 `expect()`-inside-`for..of` sites; 557 without an explicit non-emptiness
    guard, but 383 of those iterate a literal array (cannot be empty). 69 iterate a computed
    collection — each triaged; none is empty today (measured).
  - Comment-satisfaction scan: 501 test files read source with `readFileSync`; 1 real instance of an
    assertion satisfiable only by a comment (rest were my own scanner's false positives on YAML/MD).
  - SQL probes: 16 `*-check.sql`, globbed by `run-probes.sh`. Transaction/cleanup discipline measured.
  - N+1 scan over app/ + lib/ + components/: 75 sequential loops containing a Supabase round trip.
NEXT: end-to-end flow trace (signup -> family -> invite -> child login -> chore -> reward -> wallet);
  timezone/DST edge cases beyond F-017; empty-state and single-member-family edge cases.
FILES-EXAMINED: see per-finding paths, plus tests/ (corpus-wide scans), docs/audit/*.sql,
  app/api/cron/*, lib/server/notification-emails.ts, lib/network/compare-line-server.ts, vercel.json.
BLOCKERS: none. No live Supabase in this sandbox (127.0.0.1:54321 refused), so findings are
  established from the installed library's own contract + the repository's own contradicting call sites.

## Findings

### [CLAUDE-4][HIGH][EDGE CASE] Three production paths read only the first 50 auth users, and one of them marks the rest delivered

- **File/path:**
  - `app/api/cron/weekly-digest/route.ts:38`
  - `app/api/cron/chore-reminders/route.ts:103`
  - `lib/server/notification-emails.ts:66`
- **Problem:** All three resolve recipient email addresses with a bare
  `await supabase.auth.admin.listUsers()`. That call is **paginated and defaults to 50 users per
  page**. None of the three passes `perPage`, and none follows the `nextPage` the call returns. Every
  user from the 51st onward is absent from the `emailByUserId` / `userMeta` map, and each site then
  treats "no email on file" as an ordinary skip.

  This is F-008's class (a silent row ceiling) on a surface F-008's fix could not reach. The fix for
  F-008 was `readAll()` over PostgREST `.range()`; the Auth Admin API is a different transport, so the
  `.limit(n > 1000)` sweep (F-013) and the `readAll` conversion both passed straight over it. The
  weekly digest shows this on adjacent lines — a comment at line 26 reads *"Every household, not the
  first thousand... families past that ceiling would silently never receive a digest"*, and twelve
  lines later the recipient lookup reintroduces exactly that ceiling at 50.

- **Evidence:**

  The installed client documents the default itself:

      $ sed -n '405,432p' node_modules/@supabase/auth-js/dist/main/GoTrueAdminApi.js
          * @param params An object which supports `page` and `perPage` as numbers, to alter the paginated results.
          * @remarks
          * - Defaults to return 50 users per page.
          * @example Paginated list of users
          *   const { data: { users }, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.listUsers({
          *     page: 1, perPage: 1000 })

  With no params the client sends empty `page`/`per_page` query values, so the server default applies
  (`GoTrueAdminApi.js:441-442`), and the response carries `nextPage` / `lastPage` / `total`
  (`:436`, `:450-458`) — the endpoint is unambiguously a page, not a table.

  The repository already knows this, which is the decisive evidence: of the six call sites, two
  paginate deliberately and three do not.

      $ grep -rn "listUsers(" app/ lib/ scripts/
      app/api/cron/weekly-digest/route.ts:38:   ...listUsers();                        <- page 1 only
      app/api/cron/chore-reminders/route.ts:103:...listUsers();                        <- page 1 only
      lib/server/notification-emails.ts:66:     ...listUsers();                        <- page 1 only
      app/(app)/admin/security/page.tsx:32:     ...listUsers({ perPage: 1000 })        <- explicit
      lib/server/health.ts:37:                  ...listUsers({ page: 1, perPage: 1 })  <- explicit, a liveness ping
      scripts/seed-personas.mjs:44:             ...listUsers({ page, perPage: 100 })   <- a real pagination loop

  What each site does with a missing address:

      weekly-digest/route.ts:89     if (!adminEmail) continue;            // not counted in `failed`
      chore-reminders/route.ts:118  if (!email) continue;                 // not counted in `failed`
      notification-emails.ts:94-99  if (emailOff.has(userId) || !meta?.email) {
                                      skipped += 1;
                                      resolvedIds.push(...ids);           // <-- marked delivered
                                      continue; }
      notification-emails.ts:114-115 await supabase.from('notifications')
                                       .update({ sent_at: nowIso }).in('id', resolvedIds);

- **Impact:** On any deployment with more than 50 auth users:
  - **Weekly digest** and **chore reminders** silently stop reaching most of the user base. Both
    respond `{ sent, failed }` with `failed === 0`, so the run is HTTP 200 and looks clean — the exact
    blindness Claude-1's cron-visibility fix was written to remove, reappearing one layer up.
  - **`notification-emails.ts` is the severe one.** A user past the page boundary has
    `!meta?.email` evaluate true, so their notifications are pushed into `resolvedIds` and written
    `sent_at = now()`. They are marked delivered while no email was ever sent, and because `sent_at`
    is the "already handled" marker, **they are never retried**. This is unrecoverable per
    notification, not merely a delayed send. It also masks itself in the return value: those rows land
    in `skipped`, the same bucket as a legitimate opt-out, so the count that would reveal it is
    indistinguishable from normal.
- **Recommended fix:** Resolve recipients by id instead of by listing. There is no
  `getUsersByIds`, so the two honest options are (a) a shared `listAllUsers()` helper that loops
  `page` until `nextPage` is null — the shape `scripts/seed-personas.mjs:44` already uses — or, better
  for the two cron routes which already know their recipient ids, (b)
  `admin.getUserById(id)` per recipient, or a join against `profiles`/`family_members` for the address
  if one is stored there. Separately, in `notification-emails.ts` split the `!meta?.email` branch out
  of the opt-out branch: an unknown address is a **failure** (leave `sent_at` null so the next run
  retries), not a settled skip. Whatever the helper, it must be proved load-bearing by seeding 51+
  users and asserting the 51st is reached — the current guard cannot (see the next finding).
- **Status:** OPEN — verified from the installed library's contract and the repository's own
  contradicting call sites. Not reproduced against a live GoTrue: no Supabase is reachable in this
  sandbox (`curl 127.0.0.1:54321/auth/v1/health` -> connection refused).

### [CLAUDE-4][MEDIUM][TESTING] The only guard on the two digest crons asserts that identifiers are spelled, not that anything works

- **File/path:** `tests/digest-cron-read-boundary.test.ts`
- **Problem:** The file that exists to protect the weekly-digest and chore-reminder read boundaries
  contains nine assertions, and every one of them is `expect(<file text>).toContain('<identifier>')`.
  It never imports, calls or renders either route. It is satisfied by the *word* appearing anywhere in
  the file — including inside a comment or a string.
- **Evidence:** the whole file is 22 lines; the assertions are:

      expect(chore).toContain('familiesError');
      expect(chore).toContain('authUsersError');
      expect(chore).toContain('let failed = 0;');
      expect(chore).toContain('{ status: failed === 0 ? 200 : 502 }');
      expect(weekly).toContain('familiesError');
      expect(weekly).toContain('authUsersError');
      expect(weekly).toContain('familyDataError');
      expect(weekly).toContain('adminMemberError');
      expect(weekly).toContain('{ status: failed === 0 ? 200 : 502 }');

  Reasoned through precisely, three separate real regressions leave it green:
  1. Delete the body of `if (authUsersError) { ... return 500 }` but keep the condition — the token
     `authUsersError` is still present, test passes, the route now proceeds with `authUsers` undefined.
  2. Change `if (ok) sent++; else failed++;` to `if (ok) sent++;` — `let failed = 0;` and the status
     ternary are both still present verbatim, test passes, every send failure becomes invisible.
  3. The pagination defect in the finding above: it is **structurally invisible** to this test. No
     string in it mentions recipients, pages or counts.

  Contrast with `tests/cron-failed-runs-are-visible.test.ts`, which Claude-1 proved load-bearing by
  reverting each of five fixes individually. The digest guard has never been through that.
- **Impact:** Two of the twenty-four scheduled jobs are covered only by a spell-checker. The risk is
  not that the guard is useless — it is that the coverage matrix counts it as covered, so nobody
  writes the behavioural test. That is the repository's recorded defect class exactly.
- **Recommended fix:** replace with a behavioural test of the kind the repo already writes elsewhere:
  stub `createServiceClient` and `sendReactEmail`, drive `GET()` with (a) an auth read error -> expect
  500, (b) one failing send -> expect 502 and `failed: 1`, (c) **51 users and 51 families -> expect 51
  sends**, which is the case that would have caught the finding above. Prove it load-bearing by
  reverting each branch in turn.
- **Status:** OPEN

### [CLAUDE-4][MEDIUM][PERFORMANCE] The weekly digest is an unbounded per-family serial loop on a route with no `maxDuration`

- **File/path:** `app/api/cron/weekly-digest/route.ts` (loop at `:48`);
  `app/api/cron/chore-reminders/route.ts`
- **Problem:** The digest reads **every** family via `readAll` (correctly unbounded, post-F-008) and
  then processes them one at a time. Per family: four reads in parallel via `settleAll`, then a
  sequential `adminMember` read, then `loadCompareLine` (1–3 further sequential reads), then one
  `sendReactEmail` network call. So each family costs 2–4 sequential round trips plus one email API
  call, and the loop has no concurrency, no batching and no checkpoint. Neither this route nor
  `chore-reminders` declares `maxDuration`, so both run under the platform default rather than a
  chosen budget.
- **Evidence:**

      $ grep -rn "maxDuration" app/api/cron/ | wc -l
      9                       # 9 of 24 routes choose a budget
      $ sed -n '1,16p' app/api/cron/weekly-digest/route.ts   | grep "export const"
      (no runtime/maxDuration export)
      $ sed -n '1,16p' app/api/cron/chore-reminders/route.ts | grep "export const"
      (no runtime/maxDuration export)

  Per-family sequential cost, counted from source:
  `route.ts:53-63` settleAll (4 reads, parallel) -> `:74-80` adminMember (1) ->
  `lib/network/compare-line-server.ts:18,31,39` (up to 3, each awaited in turn) -> `:93` sendReactEmail.

  The repository already solved this shape once and wrote down why —
  `app/api/cron/model-refresh/route.ts:33`: *"cron scales to thousands of families without blowing
  maxDuration. The dirty [queue]..."* — and `provider-sync`, `library-feeds`, `marketing` each carry
  `maxDuration = 300` with an explicit bounded batch. The digest is the same shape without the lesson.
- **Impact:** The run is killed mid-loop once the family count exceeds the budget. Because the loop
  always walks `families` in the same `order('id')` sequence and keeps no cursor, the **same prefix of
  families is served every week and the tail is never served at all** — a stable, invisible partition
  of the customer base. It compounds the finding above rather than duplicating it: pagination silently
  drops recipients, the timeout silently drops families.
- **Recommended fix:** give both routes an explicit `maxDuration`, bound the batch (a `digest_runs`
  cursor, or `last_digest_at` on `families` with `order('last_digest_at', { nullsFirst: true })`) so a
  killed run resumes where it stopped rather than restarting at the same families, and hoist the
  per-family `loadCompareLine` reads into one cohort query outside the loop. The bounded-batch pattern
  in `provider-sync` is the in-repo precedent to copy.
- **Status:** OPEN
