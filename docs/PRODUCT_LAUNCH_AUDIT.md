# Product Launch Audit Ledger

This is the issue-level evidence ledger for launch. Each entry includes the required service, route,
role, scenario, severity, launch impact, root cause, resolution, Supabase impact, tests, validation,
commit, status, and remaining dependency. New findings must be added before or with their repair.

## Resolved Issues

### PLA-0409 - Home module CRUD reported success while silently losing warranties, contractors, and service records

- Timestamp: 2026-07-16 20:15 UTC
- Service: Home / Household management (Warranties, Pros/Contractors, Service Records)
- Route: `/dashboard/home/warranties`, `/dashboard/home/pros`, `/dashboard/home/service`
- Affected files: `app/(app)/dashboard/home/actions.ts`, `tests/home-actions-write-boundary.test.ts`
- Role: any family member who can edit household records
- Scenario: a warranty/contractor/service-record insert, update, or soft-delete fails (RLS denial, constraint violation, outage) while the user submits the form
- Severity: P1
- Launch impact: six `void`-returning form actions (`saveWarrantyAction`, `deleteWarrantyAction`, `saveContractorAction`, `deleteContractorAction`, `saveServiceRecordAction`, `deleteServiceRecordAction`) discarded the write result entirely, then called `revalidatePath` and returned normally — so on any write failure the modal closed and the page refreshed as if the save succeeded, while the record was never persisted (silent data loss the user believes succeeded); the same file's newer `scheduleRecommendedTasksAction` already checked its error, so the module was internally inconsistent
- Root cause: `await supabase.from(...).insert/update(...)` results were never destructured or inspected; a PostgREST failure returns `{ error }` without throwing
- Resolution: capture `{ error }` on every write and `throw new Error(describeActionError(error, '…'))` on failure — the established idiom already used in `social`/`kitchen`/`trip-intel` actions — so the client transition rejects, the modal stays open, and the failure is surfaced instead of faked; the best-effort `home_assets.last_serviced_on` refresh (record already saved) now logs its error rather than throwing
- Supabase impact: none; writes unchanged, only their failures are now surfaced/observable
- Tests run: `tests/home-actions-write-boundary.test.ts` (insert failure throws, success resolves, delete failure throws), full suite 513 files / 3,280 tests, eslint clean, typecheck clean
- Validation evidence: boundary test drives a mocked failing client and asserts `saveWarrantyAction`/`deleteWarrantyAction` reject while a successful client resolves
- Commit: (this increment)
- Status: Resolved in code and pushed to `main`; live RLS/role verification of the surfaced errors remains a standing dependency
- Remaining dependencies: authenticated per-role write verification once test credentials are available (LB-005 adjacent); other bare-write modules flagged in the audit backlog below

### PLA-0408 - Daily reasoning snapshot silently dropped write failures, breaking "since yesterday" trends

- Timestamp: 2026-07-16 20:10 UTC
- Service: AI reasoning history (`loadAndSnapshotReasoning`) — persists the daily snapshot that powers "since yesterday" reasoning deltas
- Route: `lib/reasoning/engine-server.ts`
- Affected files: `lib/reasoning/engine-server.ts`, `tests/reasoning-engine-read-boundary.test.ts`
- Role: any family; every surface that shows day-over-day reasoning trends
- Scenario: the `reasoning_snapshots` upsert fails (drifted table, RLS denial, outage) while persisting today's snapshot
- Severity: P2
- Launch impact: the upsert was awaited inside a `try/catch`, but a PostgREST write failure returns `{ error }` without throwing — so the `catch` never fired, the result was discarded, and a broken `reasoning_snapshots` table would silently drop every daily snapshot, leaving "since yesterday" trend comparisons permanently empty with no operational signal
- Root cause: the upsert result was not destructured or inspected; only thrown exceptions were guarded
- Resolution: inspect the returned `{ error }` and log via `console.error('[reasoning-engine] reasoning_snapshots upsert failed', { familyId, error })` (and log a genuine throw) while preserving the best-effort "return the report regardless" behavior — consistent with PLA-0406/0407
- Supabase impact: none; the write itself is unchanged, only its failure is now observable
- Tests run: `tests/reasoning-engine-read-boundary.test.ts` (now 4 — read + write boundaries, failure logs + success silence), full suite 512 files / 3,277 tests, eslint clean
- Validation evidence: boundary test asserts the `reasoning_snapshots upsert failed` log fires on error and the report is still returned; success path asserts the log does not fire
- Commit: (this increment)
- Status: Resolved in code and pushed to `main`; production log-based alerting on the `[reasoning-engine]` signals remains a standing observability dependency
- Remaining dependencies: route these signals into monitoring once provisioned (A-20 / LB-008 adjacent)

### PLA-0407 - Family reasoning report swallowed a family_signals read failure as "all clear"

- Timestamp: 2026-07-16 20:07 UTC
- Service: AI reasoning report (`loadReasoningReport`) consumed by every six-question reasoning surface (Briefing, Calm, Decisions, Outcomes, Agents, dashboard reasoning strips)
- Route: `lib/reasoning/engine-server.ts`
- Affected files: `lib/reasoning/engine-server.ts`, `tests/reasoning-engine-read-boundary.test.ts`
- Role: any family; every surface that renders the reasoning report
- Scenario: the `family_signals` read fails (RLS denial, drifted table, outage) while the report is assembled
- Severity: P2
- Launch impact: the R10 hard-signals read used `const { data } = …` inside a `try/catch`, but a PostgREST failure returns `{ data: null, error }` without throwing — so the `catch` never fired, the error was discarded, and the report silently degraded to zero signals, reporting "all clear" on the behavioral-signals dimension even when the signals table was broken
- Root cause: the destructure dropped `error`, and the `try/catch` only guarded against thrown exceptions, not returned PostgREST errors
- Resolution: capture `error` and log via `console.error('[reasoning-engine] family_signals read failed', { familyId, error })` while preserving the intentional degrade-to-calm behavior; also log if the read genuinely throws — consistent with the PLA-0406 shared-loader treatment
- Supabase impact: none; read-only diagnostics only
- Tests run: `tests/reasoning-engine-read-boundary.test.ts` (logs + produces a 6-answer report on failure; silent on success), `tests/reasoning-engine.test.ts`, full suite 512 files / 3,275 tests, eslint clean
- Validation evidence: boundary test asserts the `[reasoning-engine] family_signals read failed` log fires and the report still returns all six answers; success path asserts the log does not fire
- Commit: (this increment)
- Status: Resolved in code and pushed to `main`; production log-based alerting on the `[reasoning-engine]` / `[reasoning-context]` signals remains a standing observability dependency
- Remaining dependencies: route these signals into monitoring once provisioned (A-20 / LB-008 adjacent)

### PLA-0406 - Shared reasoning-context graph loader swallowed read failures with zero telemetry

- Timestamp: 2026-07-16 20:00 UTC
- Service: AI reasoning substrate (Knowledge Graph → every AI surface: FOI, Concierge, Briefing, Playbook, Calm, Decisions, Prep-Plans, Agents)
- Route: `lib/reasoning/context.ts` (`loadFamilyGraph`), consumed by all graph-backed dashboard/AI routes
- Affected files: `lib/reasoning/context.ts`, `tests/reasoning-context-read-boundary.test.ts`
- Role: any family; every authenticated AI surface that calls `loadFamilyContext`
- Scenario: `graph_entities` / `graph_edges` read fails (drifted table, RLS denial, outage) while an AI surface loads the family reasoning context
- Severity: P2
- Launch impact: graceful degradation to an empty graph is intentional (the graph is a reasoning *enhancement*, not a source of truth, so it must never crash a surface), but the read error was swallowed with `?? []` and no log — a persistently broken graph table would silently make every AI surface reason over 0 entities forever with no operational signal
- Root cause: `loadFamilyGraph` mapped `ents.data ?? []` / `edges.data ?? []` and discarded `ents.error` / `edges.error` entirely
- Resolution: log each read failure via the established `console.error('[reasoning-context] … read failed', { familyId, error })` convention (86-site pattern in `lib/`) while preserving the intentional empty-graph degradation — resilience unchanged, observability restored
- Supabase impact: none; read-only diagnostics only
- Tests run: `tests/reasoning-context-read-boundary.test.ts` (degrades-without-throwing + logs on failure, silent on success), `tests/reasoning-context.test.ts`, full suite 511 files / 3,273 tests, eslint clean, typecheck clean
- Validation evidence: boundary test asserts an empty graph is returned (no throw) and both `[reasoning-context]` failure logs fire; success path asserts rows map and nothing is logged
- Commit: (this increment)
- Status: Resolved in code and pushed to `main`; live drifted-table alerting wiring remains a standing observability dependency
- Remaining dependencies: route the `[reasoning-context]` signal into production log-based alerting once monitoring is provisioned (A-20 / LB-008 adjacent)

### PLA-0405 - Control-byte corruption in the audit ledger and the Google sync content hash

- Timestamp: 2026-07-16 19:50 UTC
- Service: Launch-audit control plane + Calendar/Tasks sync (change detection)
- Route: `docs/PRODUCT_LAUNCH_AUDIT.md`, `TEST_EVIDENCE.md`, `todo.md`, `lib/sync/providers/google.ts`
- Affected files: `docs/PRODUCT_LAUNCH_AUDIT.md`, `TEST_EVIDENCE.md`, `todo.md`, `lib/sync/providers/google.ts`, `lib/sync/providers/google-adapter.ts`
- Role: all (control plane) / any family with Google Calendar or Tasks sync enabled
- Scenario: full test gate run + Google↔Microsoft provider-neutral change-detection hashing
- Severity: P1
- Launch impact: the audit ledger was binary-corrupted (unreadable, control-plane guard red); Google's duplicated content hash had drifted from the shared implementation, so cross-provider change detection could diverge and re-sync or miss updates
- Root cause: stray control bytes (NUL + `0x01`–`0x1f`) were written into several tracked files by an interrupted/concurrent writer; a raw `0x01` byte inside `parts.join('…')` in Google's duplicated hash masqueraded as `join('')` and had silently replaced the intended shared `join('\x01')` separator; the historical `PLA-0281` anchor entry had also been rotated out of the ledger
- Resolution: stripped all stray control bytes from the four files (repo-wide scan now clean); restored the genuine `PLA-0281` entry (commit `7a20e160`) from git; deduplicated Google's change-detection hash to re-export the single shared `lib/sync/hash` implementation so Google and Microsoft can never drift again, and removed the now-dead `createHash` import
- Supabase impact: none directly; correctness of Calendar/Tasks two-way sync change detection restored (hashes are compared only to themselves, so no historical data migration needed)
- Tests run: `tests/launch-audit-docs.test.ts` (control plane, green), `tests/sync-adapter.test.ts` provider-neutral parity (green), `tests/sync-crypto.test.ts`, full suite 510 files / 3,270 tests, eslint, and a repo-wide control-byte scan (0 findings)
- Validation evidence: `git ls-files` control-byte scan returns empty; `google/microsoft hash the same normalized event identically` passes; full green suite
- Commit: (this increment)
- Status: Resolved in code and pushed to `main`; live Google/Microsoft sync smoke remains a standing dependency
- Remaining dependencies: authenticated live two-way sync verification once provider credentials are available (LB-006)

- Status: Resolved in source; live and deployed verification remain open.
- Severity: P1.
- Surface: `/dashboard/command-center`.
- Finding: member, event, chore, meal-plan, document, or Operating Index reads could fail while the Command Center calculated a readiness score from partial data.
- Repair: the route now preserves all five primary read errors and catches Operating Index load failures, returning a retryable page failure before computing score or issues.
- Evidence: focused Command Center boundary suite (1 assertion), full 510 test files/3,270 tests, typecheck, lint, clean 250-route build, and `git diff --check` passed; source commit `306aeb17`.

- Status: Resolved in source; live and deployed verification remain open.
- Severity: P1.
- Surface: `/dashboard/briefing`.
- Finding: a failed `family_operating_index` read silently removed the persisted “since yesterday” recap while the rest of the briefing rendered normally.
- Repair: the route now preserves the snapshot read error, logs it, and returns a retryable page failure before rendering the briefing.
- Evidence: focused Briefing boundary suite (1 assertion), full 509 test files/3,269 tests, typecheck, lint, clean 250-route build, and `git diff --check` passed; source commit `c56b870e`.

### PLA-0401 - Dashboard Home hid preference read failures as the wrong dashboard

- Status: Resolved in source; live and deployed verification remain open.
- Severity: P1.
- Surface: `/dashboard` without an explicit `view` query.
- Finding: a failed `user_preferences` read silently selected the AI dashboard, hiding the user's saved default view state.
- Repair: the default dashboard route now preserves the preference error and returns a retryable page failure; explicit `?view=family` and `?view=personal` routes remain independent.
- Evidence: focused Dashboard Home boundary suite (1 assertion), full 507 test files/3,267 tests, typecheck, lint, clean 250-route build, and `git diff --check` passed; source commit `49a5ec33`; published to `main` and verified by remote marker readback.
- Remaining launch gate: validate authenticated preference RLS, saved-view persistence, explicit view routing, and deployed retry behavior; broader dashboard and deployment gates remain open.

### PLA-0400 - Family Operations and Reports hid shared-signal read failures as healthy summaries

- Status: Resolved in source; live and deployed verification remain open.
- Severity: P1.
- Surface: `/dashboard/family-operations` and `/family/reports`.
- Finding: shared signal reads could fail while household completion, stress, bills, and task summaries rendered from an exception or zero-valued fallback.
- Repair: both routes now consume the status-preserving signal result and return retryable page failures before rendering summary metrics.
- Evidence: focused Family Summary boundary suite (1 assertion), full 506 test files/3,266 tests, typecheck, lint, clean 250-route build, and `git diff --check` passed; source commit `dd3c2929`.

- Status: Resolved in source; live and deployed verification remain open.
- Severity: P1.
- Surface: `/dashboard/family-stress`.
- Finding: signal, active-member, or logged-stress-input reads could fail while the forecast, member selector, and “No signals” state rendered as healthy.
- Repair: the route now preserves all required Supabase errors and returns a retryable page failure before exposing the forecast or logging controls.
- Evidence: focused Family Stress boundary suite (1 assertion), full 505 test files/3,265 tests, typecheck, lint, clean 250-route build, and `git diff --check` passed; source commit `c4c3cb5f`.

- Status: Resolved in source; live and deployed verification remain open.
- Severity: P1.
- Surface: `/dashboard/contacts/[id]`.
- Finding: contact lookup failures could look like a missing contact, while interaction and communication failures rendered an empty timeline.
- Repair: the route now preserves all three Supabase errors and returns a retryable page failure before building relationship health or timeline views.
- Evidence: focused Contact Timeline boundary suite (1 assertion), full 503 test files/3,263 tests, typecheck, lint, clean 250-route build, and `git diff --check` passed; source commit `ae763b67`.

- Status: Resolved in source; live and deployed verification remain open.
- Severity: P1.
- Surface: `/marketplace/selling`.
- Finding: the listing query and six seller-signal queries could fail while the seller cockpit rendered zero listings, offers, questions, or handoffs.
- Repair: all required listing and signal results are checked before deriving attention rankings or rendering the empty seller state; failures return a retryable page state.
- Evidence: focused Selling boundary suite (1 assertion), full 498 test files/3,258 tests, typecheck, lint, clean 250-route build, and `git diff --check` passed; source commit `db158e01`.
- Remaining launch gate: validate authenticated seller RLS, signal-table availability, buyer/seller workflows, and deployed retry behavior; broader payment and deployment gates remain open.

### PLA-0391 - Live Auctions hid listing read failures as an empty marketplace

- Status: Resolved in source; live and deployed verification remain open.
- Severity: P1.
- Surface: `/marketplace/auctions`.
- Finding: the marketplace listing query could fail while the route rendered “No live auctions right now” and zero operational stats.
- Repair: the Supabase error is checked before deriving auction stats or rendering the empty state; failures return a retryable page state.
- Evidence: focused Live Auctions boundary suite (1 assertion), full 497 test files/3,257 tests, typecheck, lint, clean 250-route build, and `git diff --check` passed; source commit `f86dd8a2`.

- Repair: added a status-preserving config read helper and require both config and referral reads to succeed before metrics, settings, or activity render.
- Evidence: focused Referrals boundary suite (1 assertion), full 496 test files/3,256 tests, typecheck, lint, clean 250-route build, and `git diff --check` passed; source commit `2b06e789`.
- Remaining launch gate: validate live Super Admin authorization, referral settings/activity availability, and deployed retry behavior; Auth Admin and broader launch blockers remain open.

### PLA-0389 - New Campaign hid segment read failures as an unfiltered audience selector

- Status: Resolved in source; live and deployed verification remain open.
- Severity: P1.
- Surface: `/admin/marketing/campaigns/new`.
- Finding: the `marketing_segments` query could fail while campaign creation rendered a “No segment” fallback and allowed an unfiltered campaign.
- Repair: the Supabase error is checked before rendering the campaign form; failures return a retryable page state instead of silently removing audience targeting.
- Evidence: focused New Campaign boundary suite (1 assertion), full 495 test files/3,255 tests, typecheck, lint, clean 250-route build, and `git diff --check` passed; source commit `d600ad7c`.

### PLA-0281 - Goal funding could debit without updating goal progress

- Timestamp: 2026-07-15 07:49 America/New_York
- Service: Family Wallet savings goals
- Route: `/wallet/goals`
- Affected files: `supabase/migrations/0208_atomic_wallet_goal_funding.sql`, `lib/wallet/server.ts`, `lib/database.types.ts`, `app/(app)/wallet/actions.ts`, `tests/wallet-goal-persistence.test.ts`
- Role: parent/guardian manager
- Scenario: Save-bucket balance is checked, debit is inserted, and goal update/audit fails or races
- Severity: P1
- Launch impact: money can leave the Save bucket without matching goal progress
- Root cause: separate best-effort client writes and non-locking balance read
- Resolution: manager-checked row-locking RPC atomically rechecks balance, debits ledger, updates goal/status, and writes audit
- Supabase impact: new `wallet_fund_goal` function and migration `0208`; typed wrapper replaces direct writes
- Tests run: focused goal/atomic contracts, 403-file/3,024-test suite, typecheck, lint, audit, schema probes, seed invariant, clean build
- Validation evidence: `tests/wallet-goal-persistence.test.ts`, `npm.cmd run db:audit:schema`, 250-route build
- Commit: `7a20e160`
- Status: Resolved in code and pushed to `main`; remote migration application remains a dependency
- Remaining dependencies: reconcile/apply migration remotely, then run authenticated wallet concurrency smoke
